# Pre-arrival

In order to use our time together efficiently, there are a number of things that you should do before participating in SICSS-Duke 2020. Our TAs will host office hours through Slack to support you as you work through these pre-arrival materials.

## Videos

SICSS-Duke 2020 will be using a [flipped classroom model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) where you will watch videos of lectures before our meetings, and then we will use our time together for discussion and group activities. We expect to post about 10 hours worth of videos by May 15, 2020. If you'd like to have a sense of what these videos are like, you can watch our [lectures from 2019](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/curriculum).

## Coding

The majority of the coding work presented at the 2020 SICSS will employ R.  However, you are welcome to employ a language of your choice, such as Python, Julia, or other languages that are commonly used by computational social scientists. If you would like to work in R, we recommend that you complete the free [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers), which can be supplemented by the open access book _[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)_ by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.  RStudio Primers cover 6 topics: The Basics, Working with Data, Visualize Data, Tidy Your Data, Iterate, and Write Functions.  If you already feel comfortable with these topics (either in R or some other language), then you do not need to complete these Primers.

If you would like more practice after completing the RStudio Primers, some other materials that we can recommend are:
- [R for Social Science](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/), Data Carpentry.  
- [Introduction to R for Social Scientists](https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/), Taught by Charles Lanfear at University of Washington. This course includes videos of lectures, slides, and assignments.
- [Learn R](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r), Code Academy.

## Reading

The Summer Institute will bring together people from many fields, and therefore we think that asking you to do some reading before you arrive will help us use our time together more effectively.  In order to prepare for SICSS, you should read Mattâ€™s book, *[Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com)* ([Read online](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/) or purchase from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Social-Research-Digital-Age/dp/0691158649), [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/bit-by-bit-matthew-salganik/1125483924), [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780691158648), or [Princeton University Press](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11057.html)). Parts of this book, which is a broad introduction to computational social science, will be review for most of you, but if we all read this book ahead of time, then we can use our time together for more advanced topics.

## Office hours

Our TAs will host weekly office hours through the SICSS 2020 Slack.  We will post the office hours schedule here soon.  If you are not able to attend during the regularly scheduled office hours, please contact one of the TAs to arrange a different time to meet.
