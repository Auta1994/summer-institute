> **_ATTENTION:_**  We are closely monitoring the progress of covid-19, especially in the New York City metropolitan area. We will take every precaution necessary to protect participants, staff, and the broader community. For now, we are not cancelling the SICSS-NYU, but will make adjustments as necessary and as the situation progresses. We encourage participants to apply! The deadline has been extended to May 1, 2020 at midnight EST.


From the morning of June 15 to June 20 2020, New York University will sponsor a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About twenty participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire one-week program.

Application materials are due by midnight EST on May 1, 2020.
