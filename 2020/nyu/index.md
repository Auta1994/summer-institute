**_ATTENTION:_  Dear applicants for the NYU-Summer Institute of Computational Social Science,
We are deeply sorry to announce that, in light of the situation with Covid-19 in NYC, we are forced to postpone the NYU institute until next summer. <br><br>
This is very sad news: we had anticipated a very strong set of participants and had already lined up an exciting set of speakers. However, having thoroughly discussed the issues with the core site (Duke-SICSS), it has become clear that having an in-person institute in New York City this summer is not a possibility. <br><br>
We thank you for your patience throughout this process, and for all of the effort put into your applications. We want to alert you that SICSS will have pre-recorded lectures available online to access much of the content that we had planned to cover this upcoming summer. We encourage you to check out these excellent resources. In addition BAY-SICSS is still accepting applications for their virtual institute, should you wish to send your materials there.<br><br>
We know this is disappointing but we hope to see you all apply again next summer. We wish you all the best in your research endeavors and, of course, please feel free to contact us with any questions at carly.knight@nyu.edu. <br><br>
Please all take care and stay healthy.<br>
Carly Knight & Taylor Brown**


New York University will sponsor a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About twenty participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire one-week program.
