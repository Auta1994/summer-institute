**Updates** 

BAY-SICSS is going virtual! Our institute will take place primarily over Zoom, and we are developing an entirely-digital curriculum as we speak. This means we won't be using any physical meeting space (previously we thought it would be at BIDS, UC Berkeley). This new format will ensure safety for our participants, and we hope it will also increase the accessibility and social impact of our institute. 

We will be following the emerging best practices for overcoming Zoom Fatigue, including emphasizing collaborative work (e.g., with Breakout Rooms). We may also opt for a smaller number of participants, which--in this less immersive format--we hope will help build community around doing computational social science for social good. We further intend to encourage research projects directed toward some public good or deliverable (e.g., apps, blog posts), in addition to collaboration with our social good-oriented nonprofit partners.

An important logistical change is that BAY-SICSS will be 3 weeks long, which will increase the flexibility and dynamism of our programming--especially the collaborative project aspect. The first week will be learning-focused and classroom-style--this is similar to our previous, in-person design, but now will take place over Zoom. On the other hand, the project-focused portion (previously just week 2) will now be expanded into weeks 2 and 3--allowing greater flexibility in participants' time commitments for this portion. Week 2 will also feature some centralized programming (organized by the Duke site), including panels and presentations by SICSS Alumni; week 3 will be almost entirely decentralized.

While we coordinate with our partners and TAs, we are leaving the application portal open, so folks interested in applying to the virtual incarnation of BAY-SICSS can still apply. 


**Overview**

From the evening of June 15 to June 26 2020, Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley will co-host a partner event for the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. The San Francisco Bay Area Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (BAY-SICSS) will be held at UC Berkeley campus. 

The San Francisco Bay Area Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (BAY-SICSS) has been generously supported by both Stanford University ([Institute for Research in the Social Sciences](https://iriss.stanford.edu/), [Human-Centered AI Initiative](https://hai.stanford.edu/), and [Arts and Sciences](https://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofhumanitiesandsciences/)) and UC Berkeley ([Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/) and [D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/)), and [Hopelab](https://hopelab.org/). BAY-SICSS is co-organized by [Nick Camp](https://ncamp.people.stanford.edu/), [Jaren Haber](https://www.jarenhaber.com/), and [Jae Yeon Kim](https://jaeyk.github.io/), with [Sharad Goel](https://5harad.com/) and [David J. Harding](https://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/david-j-harding).
The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science in the public interest: both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). BAY-SICSS is unique among partner locations in its focus on local community partnership, as reflected in our programming, participants, and partners. 

Our instructional program involves lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects, along with outside speakers conducting computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. During the second week, participants will co-develop a project with Bay Area nonprofits in health, criminal justice, and civil society. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source. 

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. Most participant costs during the workshop, including housing and most meals, will be covered, and most travel expenses will be reimbursed up to a set cap. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About thirty participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program held at UC Berkeley.

Application materials are due Monday, March 16, 2020.
