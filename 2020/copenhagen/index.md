From the evening of June 14 to June 26, the University of Copenhagen [Faculty of Social Sciences](https://socialsciences.ku.dk/) and the [Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences](https://healthsciences.ku.dk/) will host a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and academic staff within seven years of their PhD interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is open to both social and health scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 

The instructional program will involve lectures and group problem sets during the first week, and the opportunity for participant-led research projects in week two. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered in coordination with the Duke University site include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source. 

Applications are invited from all interested individuals with particular emphasis on graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 5 years of their Ph.D. There is no cost to participate, and we will provide lunch on all weekdays of the institute. Participation is not restricted by applicant's location, but we cannot provide support for travel or lodging in Copenhagen. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We anticipate to admit about twenty participants.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2020/copenhagen/apply) are due March 29, 2020 and we aim to make admission decisions by mid-April.
