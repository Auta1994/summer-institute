The SICSS Festival 2020 will take place Monday, June 22 - Friday, June 26, 2020. During the festival, alumni from all SICSS locations would host events such as tutorials, panel discussions, or debates.  These events will all be online.  SICSS Festival events will be open to either current SICSS participants (at any location) or anyone that is interested; the choice of audience will be driven by the topic, learning objectives, and preferences of presenters.  If you are a SICSS alumni and would like to host an event in the festival, please send us an email with a rough sketch of your idea.  We will be adding events to this website as they are finalized.

## Using Empirica for high-throughput virtual lab experiments

__Speaker:__ [Abdullah Almaatouq](www.amaatouq.com/) (SICSS-Princeton 17), [James Houghton] (http://www.jamesphoughton.com/) (SICSS-Duke 20), and Nicolas Paton.

__Description:__ [Empirica](https://empirica.ly/) is a new open source software platform for developing and conducting synchronous and interactive human-subject experiments.  It has already been used by researchers around the world. This session will start with a live demonstration where participants will take part in a real-time experiment involving dozens of people.  Next, the data from that experiment will be downloaded and analyzed.  Thus, participants will have a behind-the-scenes, end-to-end experience with an experiment run with Emprica. Finally, there will be time for questions and discussion about Empirica and the future of experiments in the social sciences.

__Open to:__ Up to 30 registered participants: Link registration form

__Time:__ June 24, 2020. 1-2:30pm EDT

__Preparatory materials:__ All registered participants are strongly encouraged to work through and watch [Empirica videos A - E] (link coming soon), which will require them to [install Empirica] (link coming soon) on their computers.

__Archiving:__ This talk will be recorded and archived.
