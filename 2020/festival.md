The SICSS Festival 2020 will take place Monday, June 22 - Friday, June 26, 2020. During the festival, alumni from all SICSS locations would host events such as tutorials, panel discussions, or debates.  These events will all be online.  SICSS Festival events will be open to either current SICSS participants (at any location) or anyone that is interested; the choice of audience will be driven by the topic, learning objectives, and preferences of presenters.  If you are a SICSS alumni and would like to host an event in the festival, please send us an email with a rough sketch of your idea.  We will be adding events to this website as they are finalized.
