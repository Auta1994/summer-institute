# Participant-led group projects

An important element of the Summer Institute is the participant-led group projects that begin in the second week and often continue long after the Summer Institute ends.  Some of the results from these projects will be posted here when they are complete.

- Türkoğlu, D., Odabaş, M., Tunaoğlu, D., Yavaş, M., (2020). Same Terms, Adverse Opinions: Assessing Competing Understandings of Democracy in Contemporary Turkey. Working Paper.

Abstract: 

How do the meanings attached to democracy in online platforms reflect political polarization in a context where the very existence of democracy is seen to be in peril? While previous research studies polarization by juxtaposing competing terminologies on the same political issues, polarization can also be reflected through attaching different meanings to the same wordings. To advance our understanding of heightened political polarization, which threatens the stability of democratic institutions, we analyze the online political discursive field during the June 2019 rerun Istanbul elections in Turkey. We collect approximately 116 thousand tweets and analyze them using both qualitative and computational methods. We find that the local rerun election was brought into the national spotlight in which the future of democracy was perceived to be at stake. We further conducted an in-depth analysis of the political discussion around three interrelated prominent themes: “democracy,” “elections,” and “public service.” Our findings indicate that public service came to be associated with an anti-corruption stance by the opposition. Conversely, for the supporters of the ruling party, public service embodies the ruling party’s past achievements. In addition, casting a vote was not simply associated with electing the preferred candidate, but more importantly, it was presented as a competition over core concepts of democracy, and even democracy itself.
