  bio: "Efe is an  industrial engineer whose interests mainly lie at the conjunction of social sciences, mathematics and statistics. This usually results in investigating questions relating to behavioural decision-making. Specifically, he would like to learn about how agents perceive and response to threat and how can automated agents that make decisions in our stead be taught (or if they should) to incorporate behavioural nuances, in a market setting.  He got his BSc and MSc degrees from Istanbul Technical University. While he is currently a research assistant at the same institute, he will continue his studies as a PhD student at Berlin School of Economics, if there is still a recognizable world come October."

  bio: "Kyle Beattie is a professor and researcher of Political Science and English as a Second Language. He obtained his BA in Political Science from Humboldt State University and his MA in Teaching: TESOL from the University of Southern California. Here is a list of his recent research. Currently, he is a PhD student at the University of Alberta in the Department of Political Science specializing in International Relations and Comparative Politics. His doctoral dissertation focuses on the field of corruption studies. Whereas most of the discipline of corruption studies has largely focused on developing world corruption, he is interested in the types of corruption that emanate from the developed world. These forms of corruption, which are often much more sophisticated, include illegal wars, economic sanctions, fiat currency manipulation, the UN veto vote, and others. He is also an amateur self-taught programmer and avid language learner. He speaks and researches in English, Spanish, and Arabic. Here is a link to his personal website to find out more."
